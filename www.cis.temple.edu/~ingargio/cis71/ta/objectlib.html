Here is a program in
the file <a href="selection.c">selection.c</a> that does selection sort.
As you can see, it uses three functions. 
<ol>
<li>One function
reads a sequence of integers.
<li>One function prints a sequence of integers. 
<li>And one function rearranges
a sequence of integers using selection sort.
</ol>
<p>
Here is how we might compile and run this program:
<p>
<pre>
    <strong>% gcc -Wall -W -o selection selection.c</strong>
    <strong>% selection</strong>
</pre>
<p>

It is easy to imagine that the three 
functions could be handy in writing other programs.
We can decompose the original program into three files:
<p>
<ol>
<li><a href="intArray.h">intArray.h</a> that contains declarations for 
the three functions
<li><a href="intArray.c">intArray.c</a> that contains the definitions of
the three functions
<li><a href="selectionMain.c">selectionMain.c</a> that contains the 
main function of the program.
</ol>
<p>
If you look in <strong>selectionMain.c</strong>, 
you will see that it includes the file
<strong>intArray.h</strong>, 
thus knows the prototypes of the three functions and the compiler can
make sure that they are used correctly in <strong>selectionMain.c</strong>.
<p>
The three files can be used as follows:
<p>
<pre>
    <strong>% gcc -Wall -W -o selection selectionMain.c intArray.c</strong>
    <strong>% selection</strong>
</pre>
<p>
The first of these two commands compiles 
<strong>selectionMain.c</strong> and <strong>intArray.c</strong>
and links them together to create the executable file 
<strong>selection</strong>. The second
of these commands executes the <strong>selection</strong> file.
<p>
We could have achieved exactly the same result with the commands:
<p>
<pre>
    <strong>% gcc -Wall -W -c intArray.c</strong>
    <strong>% gcc -Wall -W -c selectionMain.c</strong>
    <strong>% gcc -o selection selectionMain.o intArray.o</strong>
    <strong>% selection</strong>
</pre>
<p>
The first command creates the <strong>intArray.o</strong> file,
the second command creates the <strong>selectionMain.o</strong>
file. 
Notice that now if we have a bug in 
<strong>intArray.c</strong> we need only recompile
the <strong>intArray.c</strong> file [and then link]. 
And if we have a bug in 
<strong>selectionMain.c</strong> we need only recompile 
the <strong>selectionMain.c</strong> file
[and then link]. By the way, in Unix people use the utility
<strong>make</strong> to manage compilations, linking, libraries,
and the like. 
<p>
Since the odds are that the three functions will be debugged
once and then used in many programs, we may even save the object file
<strong>intArray.o</strong>
in a library [later we may keep also other useful
object files in this library].
<p>
Here is how we can create the library file, say, <strong>cis71.a</strong> :
<p>
<pre>
   <strong>% ar  -qs  cis71.a  intArray.o </strong><P>
</pre>
<p>
and here is how we can use this library to create 
the executable file <strong>selection</strong>:
<p>
<pre>
   <strong>% gcc  -Wall -W -o selection selectionMain.c  cis71.a </B><P>
</pre>
